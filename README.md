Easy map change tool for TF2 

This is a simple script for Team Fortress 2, mainly for competitive maps. 
The main feature is that you don't have to type out long commands to change maps, just enter the rcon password and the map desired.

If you think a map should be added, create a new issue with the map name and a reason why it should be added, i'll try and add the one's that are currently being played or are in the map pool.
