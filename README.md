# TF2 Competitive Commands
Map change scripts and tweaks

This is a simple script for Team Fortress 2, mainly for competitive. Mainly QoL improvments and for general ease of use.
Includes a STV workaround for those times when delaymapchange_protects pops up.
Maps from current pool (ETF2L + UGC) and some more, mostly old versions of maps or old map pool maps. (as of 2022/03/08)

> ### Features
> 
> - Easy to use commands to change maps (example: gully - changes map to gullywash)
> - STV Protect shortcut (Console or Chat rcon)
> - Shortcuts for all maps from the current map pool! (as of 2022/03/08)


If you have a suggestion please make a new issue. I'll try and add maps that are currently being played or are in the map pool.

Feel free to share and make changes to the script, but please credit me.
